# Object_Detection_FYP
This repository contains all the files needed to run our object detection model - which can take a small input of images of ovals and stars, along with their labels in XML format, to create an accurate and robust object detection model.

I have included the images and labels we used, as well as necessary files needed to run the model.

Code is well commented to ensure that it can be easily replicated.
