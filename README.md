# Object_Detection_FYP
This repository contains all the files needed to run our object detection model - which can take a small input of images of ovals and stars, along with their labels in XML format, to create an accurate and robust object detection model.

I have includeed the images and labels we used - however this model would be able to work on most labelled data.
